This repository contains demonstration code for the COP4610 Operating Systems course at Florida State University (FSU). It includes examples, exercises, and projects designed to help students grasp key OS concepts such as process management, threading, CPU scheduling, synchronization, memory management, and file systems. The provided code serves as a hands-on supplement to the lectures, allowing students to practice and explore various aspects of operating system implementation.

Key Concepts Covered:

Process Creation and Management
CPU Scheduling (e.g., Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, etc.)
Threading and Synchronization (e.g., Mutexes, Semaphores)
Memory Management and Virtual Memory
File Systems and I/O
