/*
Steps to compile and run this code:

1.  Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing this code:
    cd /path/to/your/code

2.  Compile the code using gcc:
    gcc ex_1_x++.c

3.  Run the executable:
    ./a.out

4.  Observe the output of `x` when `N` is set to 100. The result will be correct since there are fewer increments.

5.  Now, change the value of `N` to 1000000 (Line 6).

6.  Compile and run the code again, and observe the output of `x`. 
    You will likely notice incorrect results due to a race condition, where both threads are incrementing `x` simultaneously without proper synchronization, leading to errors in the final value of `x`.
